fauth
-- auth lib for fedi in 99% pure sh
---
Usage
-- ./auth gen "instance_url"
---- generates client codes and an auth link
-- ./auth auth "token"
---- uses token given from link to request auth keys
-- data saved to ./authkeys; can then be used as $AUTHFILE
---
Redirect URI
-- fauth uses urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
-- where fedish used a handmade webapp
-- this change has been made as sometimes CORS blocks the redirect
-- whereas using urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob doesn't have this issue
-- and additionally prevents the need of a webapp
